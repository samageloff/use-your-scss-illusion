# Use Your SCSS Illusion I

I recently came across a nifty “illusion” on the web, involving dots that appear to be “rolling” around a circle. You can view the original video http://youtu.be/pNe6fsaCVtI?t=24s. In actuality, the dots are each moving along their own x-axis, at a delayed interval.

Re-creating this with HTML & SCSS made for a fun web experiment.

## Getting started
* git clone https://github.com/samageloff/use-your-scss-illusion.git
* npm install
* grunt serve
